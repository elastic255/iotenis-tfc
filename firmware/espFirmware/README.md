# How to compile
Make sure that you have the Espressif IoT Development Framework (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/) properly installed.

If everything is fine (you can run some examples from the development framework) you will need to:
'''
make
'''

And, to flash the firmware:
'''
make flash
'''
